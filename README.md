# NanoBanana Hackathon Project - Mechanical X-Ray

Mechanical X-Ray is a tool that leverages the nano-banana library to generate visualizations of the internal mechanics of any given object. By analyzing input data, the project reconstructs the object's inner structure and uses Compare-image to provide intuitive side-by-side visual comparisons. This enables users to better understand and explore the hidden mechanical components within various objects.

## Features
- Mechanical Inside of the given object
- Provide samples for easy testing
- Side-by-Side Visual Comparison
